Welcome to my Marvel project.
The origin of this was a technical test exercice during my formation into "Le Reacteur"
The project was to create a website, calling an __API__ made by oursalves which is calling the Reacteur's Marvel API in order to __call all the comics and characters.__
__This website is subject to modification as I would like to implement Redux.__

All __feedback is always welcome__ as it is one of my first react project !
